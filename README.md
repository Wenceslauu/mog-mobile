Unfinished project. I aimed to create a mobile app to bring together what I liked the most about different gym tracking apps. The workout routine community from Boostcamp, the social aspect from Hevy, the amazing user experience from Strong, and many more. I managed to develop a lot of features which I am very proud of, though this project was put on hold so that I can study other fields of interest in software development.
